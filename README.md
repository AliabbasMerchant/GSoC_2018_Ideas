# GSoC_Ideas
My ideas and proposal for the GSoC 2018 project: Native Python and Processing (p5py)

This repository contains the following projects and programs:
1. An image modifier made using Processing-Java (Image_Modifier.pde)
2. A program made using pyOpenGL, to display cubes of various sizes and colours appearing at random places in 3D space. The camera moves through the 3D space and you can navigate up, down, left and right using the arrow keys. (infinite_cubes.py)
3. A prototype of the PShape (currently working on it; yet to be added)
