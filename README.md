# GSoC_Ideas
My ideas and proposal for the GSoC 2018 project: Native Python and Processing (p5py)

This repository contains the following projects and programs:
1. An image modifier made using Processing-Java (Image_Modifier.pde)
2. A program made using pyOpenGL, to display cubes of various sizes and colours appearing at random places in 3D space. The camera moves through the 3D space and you can navigate up, down, left and right using the arrow keys. (infinite_cubes.py)  

I have made a few changes to my GitHub repo [p5](https://github.com/AliabbasMerchant/p5) and have added a Prototype for `PShape` and the code for `TimeDate`.  

* The file [`TimeDate.py`](https://github.com/AliabbasMerchant/p5/blob/master/p5/sketch/TimeDate.py) contains p5py equivalents of all the Processing (Java) Date and Time functions.
* The file [`PShape.py`](https://github.com/AliabbasMerchant/p5/blob/master/p5/core/PShape.py) is a prototype of the PShape module to be made during the coding period in GSoc 2018. The prototype currently supports dynamic shape creation.

The working example of PShape and TimeDate can be found here: [link] (https://github.com/AliabbasMerchant/p5/blob/master/PShape_Demo.py)  
Also, I have created a Processing (Java) example to demonstarte the similarities: [link] (https://github.com/AliabbasMerchant/p5/tree/master/PShape_Demo)
